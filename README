# clojure-python

by Robert P. Levy

Python libraries can be used in clojure by instantiating 
a jython interpreter via clojure's excellent java interop 
library functions. However, the way in which python code 
is wrapped by jython makes interop with python clumsy and 
verbose. This library aims to make jython interop in 
clojure nearly as seamless as basic java interop.
