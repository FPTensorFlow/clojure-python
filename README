# clojure-python

by Robert P. Levy

Python libraries can be used in clojure by instantiating 
a jython interpreter via clojure's excellent java interop 
library functions. However, the way in which python code 
is wrapped by jython makes interop with python clumsy and 
verbose. This library aims to make jython interop in 
clojure nearly as seamless as basic java interop.

Contents:

src/python.clj  ; the library
etc/nltk-example/* ; example using the nltk library


Note: added project.clj to project so as to enable building with Leiningin as a dependency via Clojars.
However please note that the included nltk examples will probably require features in Jython 2.5.1,
the latest version of Jython in mvnrepository is 2.5.0 at the time of this writing.
